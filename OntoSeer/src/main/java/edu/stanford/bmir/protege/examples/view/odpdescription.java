This requires an ontology capable of more than simply documenting and annotating individual activity occurrences; definitions of activity specifications are required.\n" +

Detailed definitions of an activity's preconditions and effects are lacking, in particular with respect to a consideration of change over time. This pattern leverages existing work to fill this void with an ontology design pattern for activity specifications in OWL.";
